Project Description and Repository Usage
A project meant to showcase the ability to clean data and execute queries to extract the data in order to create visualizations in Python using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. For this project, one data set was used from NYC OpenData. The raw data set is stored in a Excel File on GitHub directly. Since this is a live data set it can be downloaded from the following links; 
( https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Pedestrian-Ramp-Complaints/jagj-gttd/about_data ) 
However, the data set may be updated over time and may not be identical to those used in the project (retrieved March 18, 2024).


The EDA Phase of the project and the code used to clean the data, as well as the results along with visualizations of those results can be found in the L-Queries-and-Visualizations.ipynb notebook, as well as in the presentation available in presentation/Gottlieb-Correa-Rai-Chunsen-CS673-Midterm-Presentation.pdf.
